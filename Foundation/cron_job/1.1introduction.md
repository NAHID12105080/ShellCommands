# Cron Job Cheat Sheet

Cron jobs are scheduled tasks in Unix-like(MacOS, Linux) operating systems that automate script or command execution at specific times or intervals.

## Crontab Syntax

Each line in crontab represents a cron job and follows this format:

##  `* * * * * /path/to/command`

Where each `*` is a placeholder for:

- **Minute** (0-59)
- **Hour** (0-23)
- **Day of the Month** (1-31)
- **Month** (1-12)
- **Day of the Week** (0-7, Sunday is 0 or 7)

**Examples:**

| Expression      | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `0 2 * * *`     | Every day at 2 a.m.                       |
